# Prediction-with-Multiple-Regression
Project 3&4 - The primary goal of this project is to understand and optimize the factors that influence profit in startups. By leveraging the "50 startups" dataset and Toyota Corolla dataset, the aim is to build a predictive model using Multiple Linear Regression to identify key drivers of profitability. The project follows a structured methodology, including a detailed exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships.The Multiple Linear Regression model is then developed and refined iteratively for improved accuracy. Model evaluation metrics such as R-squared and RMSE are used to assess performance.The project concludes with a summary of key findings, emphasizing the success in achieving the objective of optimizing profit. The Multiple Linear Regression model's high accuracy and next steps for continuous improvement are highlighted.
